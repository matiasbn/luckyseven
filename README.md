# Luckyseven
Luckyseven is a lightweight and easy to implement CSPRNG (cryptographically-secure pseudo random number generator). 

# Repository
This repository is intended to:
* Document the analysis of the Luckyseven CSPRNG using the Statistical Test Suite purposed by the [NIST](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf).
* Document several implementations of the Luckyseven algorithm.

## Directories

* sts: directory of the analysis if the Statistical Test Suite.
* lib: different language implementations
