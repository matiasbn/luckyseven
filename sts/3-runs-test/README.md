# Runs Test

The focus of this test is the total number of runs in the sequence, where a run is an uninterrupted sequence of identical bits. A run of length k consists of exactly k identical bits and is bounded before and after with a bit of the opposite value. The purpose of the runs test is to determine whether the number of runs of ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected for a random sequence. In particular, this test determines whether the oscillation between such zeros and ones is too fast or too slow.

# Parameters

This are the values of non-default parameters.

## Names

- n: bits length
- m: amount of bit streams (or samples)

## Values

- n: 4096
- m: 5000

# Results

```
The minimum pass rate for each statistical test with the exception of the
random excursion (variant) test is approximately = 4988 for a
sample size = 5000 binary sequences.
```

Being the proportion equal to 4992/5000 [result/finalAnalysisReport.txt], this test can be considered as PASSED.
