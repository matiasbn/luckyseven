# Frequency Test within a Block

The focus of the test is the proportion of ones within M-bit blocks. The purpose of this test is to determine
whether the frequency of ones in an M-bit block is approximately M/2, as would be expected under an
assumption of randomness. For block size M=1, this test degenerates to test 1, the Frequency (Monobit)
test. [1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf)]
